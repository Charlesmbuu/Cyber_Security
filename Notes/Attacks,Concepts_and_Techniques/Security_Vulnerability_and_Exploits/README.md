Before we get into the details, letâ€™s start by outlining some key terms that you need to know.
----------------
Security vulnerabilities ---> are any kind of software or hardware defect. A program written to take advantage of a known vulnerability is 
referred to as an exploit. A cybercriminal can use an exploit against a vulnerability to carry out an attack, the goal of which is to gain 
access to a system, the data it hosts or a specific resource.

Remember:

   * Emailing sensitive information such as passwords in plain text is extremely risky and is a weakness in security practice. This information should at the
     very least be encrypted.
   
   * Past employees should not have access to customer information when leaving a company. This is a serious access control problem.
   
   * New users need to be validated before anything else can be done with their data. Using an incorrectly formatted email address to log on is a non-validated
     input error.
