More about the SYNful Knock vulnerability discovered in Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) in 2015 >>>

The SYNful Knock vulnerability allowed attackers to gain control of enterprise-grade routers, such as the legacy Cisco ISR routers, from 
which they could monitor all network communication and infect other network devices.

This vulnerability was introduced into the system when an altered IOS version was installed on the routers. To avoid this, you should always 
verify the integrity of the downloaded IOS image and limit the physical access of such equipment to authorized personnel only.
