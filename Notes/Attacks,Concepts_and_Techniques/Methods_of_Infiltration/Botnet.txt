A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is 
a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or 
even hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.

These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks. 
Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties for nefarious purposes.

Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify any botnet locations.
