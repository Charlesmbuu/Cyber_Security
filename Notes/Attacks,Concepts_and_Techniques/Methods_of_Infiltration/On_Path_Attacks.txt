from or to impersonate one of the devices.

This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack.

A MitM attack happens when a cybercriminal takes control of a device without the user’s knowledge. With this level of access, an attacker can 
intercept and capture user information before it is sent to its intended destination. These types of attacks are often used to steal 
financial information.

**************************************************

There are many types of malware that possess MitM attack capabilities.

A variation of man-in-middle, MitMo is a type of attack used to take control over a user’s mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instructed to exfiltrate user-sensitive information and send it to the attackers. ZeuS is one example of a malware package with MitMo capabilities. It allows attackers to quietly capture two-step verification SMS messages that are sent to users.
