Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.

TWO MAIN TYPES OF DoS ATTACKS
######

I)  Overwhelming quantity of traffic

This is when a network, host or application is sent an enormous amount of data at a rate which it cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or the device or service to crash.

II)  Maliciously formatted packets

A packet is a collection of data that flows between a source and a receiver computer or application over a network, such as the Internet. When a maliciously formatted packet is sent, the receiver will be unable to handle it.

For example, if an attacker forwards packets containing errors or improperly formatted packets that cannot be identified by an application, this will cause the receiving device to run very slowly or crash.
