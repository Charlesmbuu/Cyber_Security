Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation 
against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.

Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually well-funded and typically targets 
organizations or nations for business or political reasons.

Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain there undetected.
