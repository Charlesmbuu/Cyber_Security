SEO Poisoning

You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about improving an organization’s website so that it 
gains greater visibility in search engine results.

Search engines such as Google work by presenting a list of web pages to users based on their search query. These web pages are ranked 
according to the relevancy of their content.

While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them, attackers take advantage of popular search terms 
and use SEO to push malicious sites higher up the ranks of search results. This technique is called SEO poisoning.

The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may host malware or attempt social engineering.
