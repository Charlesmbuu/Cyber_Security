A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:

    An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by handler systems.
    The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
    When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.
