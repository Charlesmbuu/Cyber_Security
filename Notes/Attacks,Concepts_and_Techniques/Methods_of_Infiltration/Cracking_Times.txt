Carrying out brute-force attacks involves the attacker trying several possible combinations in an attempt to guess the password. These attacks 
usually involve a word-list file â€” a text file containing a list of words from a dictionary. A program such as Ophcrack, L0phtCrack, THC Hydra, 
RainbowCrack or Medusa will then try each word and common combinations until it finds a match.

Because brute-force attacks take time, complex passwords take much longer to guess.
