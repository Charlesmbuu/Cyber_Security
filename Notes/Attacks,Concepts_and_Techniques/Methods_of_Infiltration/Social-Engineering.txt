Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.

COMMON TYPES OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS 
######

i) Pretexting

This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access to privileged data.

For example, pretending to need a person’s personal or financial data in order to confirm their identity.


II) Tailgating

This is when an attacker quickly follows an authorized person into a secure, physical location.


III) Something for something (quid pro quo)

This is when an attacker requests personal information from a person in exchange for something, like a free gift.
